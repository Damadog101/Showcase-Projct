            <h2>Kids Tips</h2>
            <p>Kids tend to enjoy playing in water, especially in the summer. If your kids use the sprinklers to cool off, make sure to use them in specific spots on your lawn where it needs the water more than others, to not waste any by overwatering. In addition, if you purchase water toys for your kids, avoid certain products that rely on the constant flow of water. If you want to go a step further, contact your child's school, and talk with them to see if they would promote water conservation at their school through their education and activities.

            <h2>Technical Tips</h2>
            <p>There are a massive amount of ways to save water, but some are more hands-on than others. For example, monitor your water bill for abnormally high numbers, which may lead you to find a leak. Learn where your master water shutoff is, in case of leaks or pipe bursts. Check your pipes, coolers, and other appliances annually, and winterize ones outdoors to prevent bursting. If you're out and about and see a fire hydrant, sprinkler, or other device leaking water, report it immediately to reduce the waste.

            <h2>Awareness Tips</h2>
            <p>Once you begin to have a greater understanding of water conservation, a great option is to share your newfound knowledge with others. Consider bringing up to the company you work at the idea of water conservation, and suggest ways you as a business can save water. You can also talk with your family, and develop plans for every member to save water. Taking it a step further, you could write articles or develop websites just like this one to share the importance of water conservation with the world.
