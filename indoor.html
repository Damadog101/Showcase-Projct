            <h2>Dishes Tips</h2>
            <p>One of the most common ways people use water is to wash dishes. If you can use fewer dishes, that is the best option, such as by having a designated drinking water glass. When you do end up going to wash dishes, soak the ones that have food stuck to them, as soaking them in water uses less than letting the sink run while you scrub. In addition to this, plug the sink or use a basin to hand wash your dishes in, saving water for the same reason. Lastly, if you use a dishwasher, and it's within your budget, purchase an energy efficient dishwasher.

            <h2>Cooking Tips</h2>
            <p>Cooking involves a lot of water, so we shouldn't let any go to waste. When washing food before usage, do it in a container, rather than by running the tap. Repurpose this water, by using it to water houseplants. The same concept applies when you have drinking water, any leftover water or ice can go to plantlife just fine. When you begin cooking, use little amounts of water, as we typically cook in more than we need. Cover your pans and pots when cooking as well, as it reduces evaporation. When cooking is done, and you have water leftover, use it to start a soup, rather than throwing it out. Lastly, install an instant water heater so you don't have to let the water run for a long time while it gets warm.

            <h2>Cleaning Tips</h2>
            <p>Cleaning is one of our largest uses for water, making room for some of the most savings. Avoid taking baths, as they use up much more gallons of water than showers. Keep showers short as well, under 5 minutes is best for getting clean but saving a good amount of water. When you begin drying off, reuse your towels, as they can last a few showers without needing to be washed. Next, when you actually begin washing your towels and clothes, be sure to only run your washing machine on full loads, and match the water level to the load size. Also try to wash dark items on a cold water setting, as it saves both water and energy. Lastly, if you have the money, consider purchasing water and resource efficient showerheads and washing machines to conserve the most water you can.

            <h2>Bathroom Tips</h2>
            <p>The bathroom is likely where the most water is used daily. With all of your faucets, make sure to turn them off when not directly in use, such as when shaving, brushing your teeth, and washing your hands. In addition to this, replace all the aerators on your faucets with ones designed for water saving. For the toilet, consider buying a water saving toilet, or a half flush toilet, which uses less water if you are only flushing liquid. The most important thing to do with your toilet, however, is to check for leaks, as hidden leaks waste an enormous amount of water. Start by putting some food coloring in the tank of your toilet; if it seeps to the bowl without flushing, there's a leak that needs fixing.
