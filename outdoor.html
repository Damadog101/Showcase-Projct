            <h2>Gardening Tips</h2>
            <p>Many people enjoy gardening, but it can use a lot of excess water if not done right. When planting, make sure to plant in places that are easy to water, so water doesn't miss and get wasted. Group plants by their water requirement, and try to plant native plants, or those with low watering needs. Prune and weed regularly, and use mulch to prevent evaporation/sprouting of new weeds. Also consider xeriscaping, which is a gardening technique where you make a section of your lawn require little to no irrigation whatsoever. This can be done in many ways, such as by replacing grass with rocks, or by incorporating plants that require little water.

            <h2>Lawn Tips</h2>
            <p>Lawns are a unique situation, as their watering schedule changes very often. If you want to check if your lawn actually needs watering, there are a few ways. If walking on a lawn leaves a footprint, or if you dig for 2-3 inches and only get dry soil, it's time to water. This process should help you develop watering schedules, however you should adjust your schedule monthly to account for the weather changes. When watering, make sure to water dry spots by hand, and adjust your sprinkler's angles so they don't spray the house or cement. When you mow your lawn, leave 1.5-2 inches of grass, as longer grass retains more moisture. In addition,  leave the lawn clippings on the grass, as they keep moisture as well. Avoid overseeding with winter grass during the colder months, or consider just letting the lawn go dormant in winter, as it will go back to normal in the summer and save water. In terms of times to water, try to water in the early mornings, and avoid windy days. Install a rain sensor as well, so your sprinklers don't turn on unnecessarily in the rain.

            <h2>Miscellaneous Tips</h2>
            <p>There are a lot of appliances and experiences outdoors, all which have their own unique water saving tips. If you have a pool, don't overfill it, and try to keep water in the pool by avoiding splashing. Cover your pool when not in use, check for leaks, and avoid using waterfalls and sprays. For your car, only wash as needed, and turn off the water when not in use if you wash at home. If you don't mind the marks, also consider washing your car on the lawn, in order to water it and clean your car at the same time. You can also do the same thing with a pet, whenever you give it a bath. Lastly, if it rains a lot where you live, install a rain barrel and collect water from your roof.
